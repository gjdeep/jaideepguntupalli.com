It was just another regular day at the campus of Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Delhi. I was working on a Next.js project with tRPC as the backend for my course project. I was implementing the email feature using nodemailer and ethereal, feeling pretty confident about my coding skills.

### **The Initial Blunder**

However, my overconfidence was about to take a hit when I realized that I had made a significant blunder while pushing my code to production. I had forgotten to update the email settings in the production environment, and it took me two whole days to realize it! Talk about a facepalm moment.

I spent countless hours trying to debug the issue. I was getting increasingly frustrated by the minute, and the whole situation was starting to feel like a nightmare.

### **The Moment of Clarity**

I was ready to throw in the towel and give up when a friend of mine, who had no technical knowledge whatsoever, asked me about the project. As I explained the project's basics, I mentioned the email feature, and my friend innocently asked, "Did you update the email settings in the production environment?"

My jaw dropped to the floor. How did I not think of that? My non-technical friend had just solved a problem that I, the supposed "expert," couldn't figure out for two whole days. I felt like a complete fool.

### **The Lesson Learned**

In hindsight, it was a silly mistake, but I learned a valuable lesson that day. Never underestimate the power of a fresh perspective, even if it comes from someone who knows nothing about coding. And, of course, always double-check your settings when pushing code to production.

So, my fellow coders, let this be a cautionary tale. Don't be like me and forget to update your settings. And if you're ever feeling stuck, don't be afraid to reach out to someone outside the tech world for a different perspective. Who knows, they might surprise you with their problem-solving skills.

### **Conclusion**

Until next time, happy coding (and updating those settings)!
